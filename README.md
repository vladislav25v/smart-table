# Smart Table — Educational Project

This educational project was developed as part of a front-end learning course.  
The main goal was to learn how to **structure code using ES modules**, **fetch and process data from a server**, and **dynamically render content** in the browser — specifically, a data table.

---

## Project Objectives

- Practice **modular JavaScript** architecture (import/export).
- Learn how to **fetch data from a server** using the Fetch API.
- Process and transform the received data before rendering.
- Dynamically **generate and render a table** in the DOM.
- Develop a clear and maintainable project structure for scaling.
- Strengthen understanding of **asynchronous code** and promises.

## Technologies

- **HTML5** — base structure
- **CSS3** — styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — modular approach and data handling
- **Fetch API / Promises / async–await** — server communication
- **DOM Manipulation** — dynamic rendering of content
- **Git / GitHub** — version control and project hosting
